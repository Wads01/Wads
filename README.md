<h2 align = "left"> About Me </h2>
  
I was born in Malolos, Bulacan, and attended the Montessori School of Malolos from nursery to grade 6. When I was young, I was fascinated by computers and games because my Mom introduced them to me. I moved to Metro Manila and enrolled in La Salle Green Hills for high school, and now I am currently learning at De La Salle University. I enrolled in this university because to pursue my bachelor of science in computer science majoring in software technology.
<br/><br/>
  
With the years I have already spent inside the university, I know how to code in multiple programming languages such as C, Java, Python, and Ruby. I have understood a lot of programming concepts, I have experience in databases and web development, I learned many algorithm techniques such as dynamic programming, greedy method, etc. and I learned the basics of Artificial Intelligence (AI) programming by creating a Sokoban Bot Solver which is one of my most favorite projects and I plan on improving it in the future to perform better.
<br/><br/>

<h2 align = "left"> Goals </h2>
1. To learn a lot more about web development and artificial intelligence <br/>
2. To have a fruitful internship experience in the future <br/>
3. To land a software-related job that could serve a lot of people <br/>
4. To be in the driver's seat in regard to AI evolution <br/>
