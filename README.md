<h2 align = "left"> About Me </h2>
I was born in Malolos, Bulacan, where I attended the Montessori School of Malolos from nursery through grade 6. My fascination with computers and games began early, thanks to my mother's introduction to technology. After moving to Metro Manila, I enrolled in La Salle Green Hills for high school and am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, majoring in Software Technology at De La Salle University.
<br/><br/>
  
Throughout my time at university, I have immersed myself in various software development projects, gaining hands-on experience in both web and mobile application development. I have utilized modern technologies such as SvelteKit, Tailwind, and Supabase for web applications, and I have developed a music player app using Kotlin and Android Studio, leveraging ExoPlayer for seamless audio playback.

My projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge of programming concepts, database management, and version control practices. Additionally, I am well-versed in Agile methodologies, having collaborated in team settings to deliver client-focused solutions. I am passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly applications and continuously strive to enhance my skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
<br/><br/>

<h2 align = "left"> Goals </h2>
1. To learn a lot more about web development and artificial intelligence <br/>
2. To have a fruitful internship experience in the future <br/>
3. To land a software-related job that could serve a lot of people <br/>
4. To be in the driver's seat in regard to AI evolution ( in retrospect, might be too much ) <br/>
